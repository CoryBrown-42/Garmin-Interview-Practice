# Git LFS Configuration for Unity Golf Course Project
# This file tracks large binary files with Git LFS to keep the main Git repository lean
# and improve performance for distributed art teams.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Binary Assets to be Tracked by Git LFS
# These are the files that typically cause repository bloat due to their size
# and frequent modifications by artists.

# Textures (Source Files - Unity will compress these for platform-specific builds)
# High-resolution source textures (PSD, TGA, PNG, etc.) are often very large.

*.bundle lfs # macOS bundles
*.dylib lfs # macOS dynamic libraries
*.a lfs # iOS static libraries

# 2. Unity-Specific Files that *SHOULD NOT* be Tracked by Git LFS
# These are primarily YAML text files that Git is excellent at diffing and merging.
# Putting these into LFS would defeat core Git functionality and lead to merge hell.

# Unity Scene and Prefab files - YAML text files
*.unity text diff=unity merge=unity
*.prefab text diff=unity merge=unity

# Asset files - includes Materials, ScriptableObjects, Animation files, etc.
*.asset text diff=unity merge=unity
*.mat text diff=unity merge=unity # Material files (explicit, often also .asset)
*.anim text diff=unity merge=unity # Animation clips
*.controller text diff=unity merge=unity # Animator controllers
*.overrideController text diff=unity merge=unity # Animator override controllers
*.rendertexture text diff=unity merge=unity # Render Texture assets (these are references, not raw binary)
*.shadervariants text diff=unity merge=unity # Shader variant collections
*.lighting text diff=unity merge=unity # Lighting settings (Global Illumination)
*.physicsmaterial text diff=unity merge=unity # Physics materials
*.physicmaterial2d text diff=unity merge=unity # 2D Physics materials
*.fontsettings text diff=unity merge=unity # Font settings assets

# Metadata files - YAML text files, crucial for Unity's asset linking.
*.meta text diff=unity merge=unity

# Code and Shader files - pure text
*.cs text
*.shader text
*.cginc text
*.hlsl text
*.glsl text
*.compute text

# Configuration and data files - generally text-based
*.json text
*.xml text
*.txt text
*.csv text
*.md text
*.yaml text
*.yml text
*.asmdef text

# Define the 'unity' diff driver for better readability of Unity YAML files.
# This generally needs to be configured in your global or local `.git/config` for visual tools,
# but `diff=unity` tells Git these files are special for diffing purposes.
# Example for .git/config:
# [diff "unity"]
#   textconv = "C:/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/<UNITY_VERSION>/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge.exe" diff "$BASENAME" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$BASE"
